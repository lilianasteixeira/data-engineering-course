## Module 1:
### Question 1:
To answer this inside the python:3.13 docker container running the command: `pip --version`, so instead of run this command to install that version `docker run -it --rm --entrypoint=bash python:3.9.16`, I install `docker run -it --rm --entrypoint=bash python:3.13` and see the version of the pip

### Question 2:
For question 2 the correct answers from my tests are `postgres:5432` and `db:5432` because the container name is postgres and the container port is 5432, other correct option could is db:5432 because service name is bd and port still 5432, i tried localhost:5432 but i receive an error of network.
